# Group Project UIX: Company Site

# STAR FACTOR:
NOTE: Team Smelly Cougars, the Cohort 24 of Nashville Software School, created this website for a fictitious company IDEO. We based the style guide on https://issuu.com/aanhalt/docs/oi_brand_guidelines_su15 we used the color palette and Lato (google font) for the website.
Smelly Cougars worked on the Persona with Insecure singer/musician. After two interviews with insecure musicians, we came up with LiAnna - The Budding Artist. 

## Plan and Design
	1.	Problem statement: How might we help LiAnna build confidence within herself and enable her to grow a fanbase?
	2.	Primary user persona: 
TYPE: Early Adopter musician that have great work ethic strives to be a perfectionist. While being empathetic, the musician cares about what people think of them. They are also tech savvy and financially stable but socially introverts. Lacks self confidence and afraid of being around people.

## HTML, CSS and JS
1. Semantic HTML was used with each page having one meaning h1.
2. Each individual page has it’s own css with a main.css style common element like nav, header image, footer.
3. Looking at the website and code, we decided to keep the majority of the written content, logo as a text, navigation titles, all pages except Shine Out page and background image on the home page.
4. We modified CSS, changed colors to make the template consistent throughout the website. 
5. We created the hero section as a place to describe page information with Call To Action. We added the Shopping Cart, Product Detail and About page and removed Shine Out page. Changed the looks of about page to show information in boxes with two columns on a page. 
7. We decided to go with one JS code for all pages. All pages contain one “hero button” that points to the tutorials page with JS in it. The tutorial page is populated by JavaScript. The Shopping Cart has javascript functionality.

## For Version 3.0:
Testimonials could be added to Shine Out page.
